# 👋 Hi, I’m Anika de Beer

I’m a **Creative Technologies student** majoring in **UX Design** and **Interactive Development** at **Open Window Institute**, South Africa.  
My work blends **design thinking** with **technical development** to create meaningful digital products — from data visualisations to full e-commerce ecosystems.

For me, design isn’t just about how things look — it’s about *why* they exist and *how* they work.  
I believe there are a thousand “why’s” behind every idea, so my motto is simple:  
> **“Why not?” — answer them.**
